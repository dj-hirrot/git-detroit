# git-detroit
By installing **git-detroit**, unnecessary local branches can be deleted at once.  
Since [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) is used for installation, please install it first.

# Installation

```bash
$ brew tap dj-hirrot/git-detroit
$ brew install git-detroit
```

# Usage
ğŸ’¥ **git-detroit will only remove those prefixed with** `features/` **.**ğŸ’¥

**git-detroit** only works for projects under Git control.  
So, first move to the directory where you want to maintain the branch.

```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/repogitory
```

You will be able to use git-detroit.
```bash
$ git-detroit
=> do you remove feature/xxxxx_xxxxx ? (y/n): y
Deleted branch feature/xxxxx_xxxxx (was xxxxxx).
```

# Idea
It is recommended to generate an alias when using it.
```bash
$ echo "alias gdes='git-detroit'" >> ~/.alias
```
